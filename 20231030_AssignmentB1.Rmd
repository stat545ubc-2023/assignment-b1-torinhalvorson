#' @description
#' scat_plot function
#' @details The following code creates a function that generates a scatterplot from a categorical variable 'catvar' and a numeric variable 'numvar'. It throws an error if catvar is not of class 'character' or numvar is not of class 'numeric'.
#' @param catvar character vector: named catvar as a short form of categorical variable, as this code is designed primarily for creating plots of from categorical and numeric data efficiently.
#' @param numvar numeric vector: named numvar as a short form for numeric variable, as this code will identify the relationship between a numeric and categorical variable from a dataset using a plot.
#' @return The function returns a scatterplot, with catvar on the x-axis and numvar on the y-axis, with points additionally coloured by catvar.
plot_scatter <- function(dat, catvar, numvar, na.rm = TRUE) {
  scat_plot <- ggplot(data = dat)
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = catvar, y = numvar, color = catvar), alpha = 0.2) + 
    theme_classic()
  return(scat_plot)
}
```

Next, we will demonstrate the usage of plot_scatter using the penguins dataset
```{r}
head(penguins)
plot_scatter(data = penguins, catvar = penguins$species, numvar = penguins$bill_length_mm)

```
